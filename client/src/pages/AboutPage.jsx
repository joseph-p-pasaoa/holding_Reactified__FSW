        <p>Welcome to holding: Reactified!! Dust off your feet and get cracking!</p>
        <br />

        <p>holDING is a reference to a "Holding Space" - a therapy term for a private physical or digital place where someone can work out their feelings while being both encouraged and expected to be better, but not in the moment judged.</p>
        <p>REFERENCE: <a href="http://efttherapycenter.com/holding-space-for-someone/">http://efttherapycenter.com/holding-space-for-someone/</a></p>
        <p>holDING is, by design, a micro social media site. A private place with limited access and reach. holDING is a place where you can stay in touch with that embarrassing aunt of yours that shares Minion memes - without the stigma of socially interacting with her. That’s because holDING is specifically NOT an open wide-reaching platform like Facebook or Twitter or YouTube or the like. It’s a place where users can interact with others without being bombarded with outrage inducing headlines and ire fueled trending topics. A place where the members of a close knit micro community can be anonymous (if they so choose) but no one is discredited, shamed, or dehumanized. No one is performing for a world-wide audience, and no one has to fear being seen by a worldwide audience.</p>
        <p>holDING takes the inherent isolation out of social media.</p>
        <p>Because with holDING, you’ll never miss a DING.</p>
